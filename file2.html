    <h3><font color="maroon">Josh says this about his work: </font></h3>
    <p><b><i>"Not a ton of people know, but I’ve self-produced almost my entire discography including the duo albums I do with Jake Hill. I also come up with a lot of the merch designs and every album cover I sketch out first in my notebook. I’m heavily involved with almost every part of the music.<Br> That’s where I get slightly jaded when I see people losing their minds over people who put in the most minimal amount of effort with their music."</i></b></p>
